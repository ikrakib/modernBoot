\title{Two-Sample Permutation Test}
\usage{
perm_test_2sample(x, y, R = 5000, stat = function(a, b) mean(a) - mean(b))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{numeric vector, first sample (group A). May contain NAs which are
removed. Minimum 2 observations required. Length need not equal length(y).}

\item{y}{numeric vector, second sample (group B). May contain NAs which are
removed. Minimum 2 observations required. Compared against x for differences.}

\item{R}{integer number of permutation replicates (default 5000).
Larger values (e.g., 10000) improve p-value accuracy. Must be >= 1.
Exact test feasible when R = C(n1+n2, n1) (factorial complexity),
otherwise uses approximate permutation distribution.}

\item{stat}{function taking two arguments (a, b) and returning numeric scalar
test statistic. Default: \code{function(a, b) mean(a) - mean(b)}
tests difference of means. Alternative: \code{function(a, b) median(a) - median(b)}
for medians, or custom statistics. Function must handle NAs gracefully.}
}
\value{
A list with three elements:
  \item{obs}{numeric scalar, the observed test statistic computed on original data}
  \item{reps}{numeric vector of length R, test statistics under random
    permutations of group labels. Represents null distribution assuming
    equal distributions between groups.}
  \item{p.value}{numeric scalar between 0 and 1, two-sided p-value computed as
    proportion of permutation replicates with |stat| >= |obs|. Value 1/R is
    smallest achievable p-value.}
}
\description{
Performs exact or approximate permutation test for comparing two independent samples.
Tests null hypothesis that two groups have equal distributions.
}
\details{
Under the null hypothesis of equal distributions, exchanging group labels
should be equally likely. The p-value is the proportion of permutations
with test statistic at least as extreme as observed (in absolute value).
