\title{Studentized Bootstrap Confidence Interval for Quantiles}
\usage{
studentized_ci(x, q = 0.5, R = 1000, Rinner = 200, conf = 0.95)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{numeric vector of data. May contain NAs which are removed.
Minimum 2 observations required. Works well for skewed distributions and
extreme quantiles where percentile bootstrap performs poorly.}

\item{q}{numeric quantile level between 0 and 1 (default 0.5 for median).
0.25 = first quartile, 0.75 = third quartile, 0.95 = 95th percentile.
Method particularly effective for extreme quantiles (q < 0.1 or q > 0.9).}

\item{R}{integer number of outer bootstrap replicates (default 1000).
This is primary bootstrap sample for t-distribution estimation.
Recommended: 500-1000 for exploration, 2000+ for publication. Must be >= 1.}

\item{Rinner}{integer number of inner bootstrap replicates for standard error
estimation of each outer replicate (default 200). Larger values increase
accuracy but also computation time (total iterations = R * Rinner).
Recommended: 100-200. Must be >= 1.}

\item{conf}{numeric confidence level between 0 and 1 (default 0.95).
Standard: 0.95 or 0.99. Higher values give wider intervals.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length 2 with names c("lower", "upper"):
  \item{lower}{numeric, lower confidence limit for the q-th quantile}
  \item{upper}{numeric, upper confidence limit for the q-th quantile}
  Uses studentized bootstrap t-distribution to construct interval,
  providing better coverage probability than percentile method,
  especially for skewed distributions and extreme quantiles.
}
\description{
Computes a studentized (t-based) bootstrap confidence interval for quantiles.
More accurate than percentile intervals, especially for extreme quantiles.
}
\details{
Studentized bootstrap uses the bootstrap t-distribution to construct intervals.
This method often provides better coverage than percentile bootstrap, especially
for skewed distributions or extreme quantiles.

Computation is intensive: O(R * Rinner) bootstrap samples are generated.
